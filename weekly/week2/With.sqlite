-- WITH statement allows us to perform a separate query (such as aggregating customerâ€™s subscriptions)
-- previous_results is the alias that we will use to reference any columns from the query inside of the WITH clause
-- We can then go on to do whatever we want with this temporary table (such as join the temporary table with another table)
